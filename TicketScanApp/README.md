## Naming convention

**BEGIN_TODO**
> _"I call them Container and Presentational components but I also heard Fat and Skinny, Smart and Dumb, Stateful and Pure, Screens and Components, etc"_

- `[Name][View?]Container` - for all _smart_ components (containers).
- `[Name]View` - for all _dumb_ components (components)

Prefer to set parents as containers, the rest as views (or pure components)
